Whenever you change your React code, you:

Build the web app:

npm run build
This repopulates build/ with your latest React app.

Sync into Android:


npx cap sync android
This copies build/ → android/app/src/main/assets/public/ (the WebView’s www folder) and updates plugins.

5. Run on Android
Finally, open or launch from the React project root:


# Open Android Studio
npx cap open android
—or directly—
npx cap run android
Capacitor will compile the native Android project and install the APK on your connected device/emulator. You should now see your real React/ArcGIS UI instead of the Capacitor splash page.
